echo '<h3>Text</h3>';
echo '<p>Along with your logo, colors, fonts and media a great addition is to include titles of a short written description to illustrate the specifics of your ideas. Add a new text box with our full text editor (WYSIWYG). Include just a header above a section by typing a title and selecting h1 or h2 or write out a complete description to better communicate your proposed solutions.</p>';

echo '<h3>Media - Images</h3>';
echo '<p>Utilize this section to showcase image assets you have for a project. Some examples include logo samples, inspirational imagery, and mockups. Use the Media â€“ Images section to add multiple image sections. And control the format of how your images appear by selecting either the Showcase, 2 or 4 Column option.</p>';

echo '<h3>Colors</h3>';
echo '<p>Once you have decided on your color scheme for the project, simply add a color section to your style guide and then enter the hex value, the CMYK and RGB colors for each of the colors in your color scheme. Add multiple color sections to represent different areas of the site, or different color groupings.</p>';

echo '<h3>Buttons</h3>';
echo '<p>Buttons are an important part of any website especially as a CTA (Click Through Action). Simply add the section and designate a color from your color scheme, and it will generate all the button sizes (with CSS classes) for that color. Add multiple button sections to your style guide for each button color.</p>';

echo '<h3>FREE Google Font Extension</h3>';
echo '<p>Included with the SG-90 is the free Google Font Extension. When you purchase and download the SG-90 be sure to also download your free copy of the Google font extension.
